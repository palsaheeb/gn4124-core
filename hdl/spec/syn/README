This example project was last tested on January 31st 2014,
using hdlmake (isyp branch, sha 6b7aa78e37cdd9b60b227834ad4ef307d242ed1b).

A binary of the generated gateware (spec_gn4124_test.bin) is stored in the
files section of the project:
http://www.ohwr.org/projects/gn4124-core/files

Procedure to generate the gateware binary:
$ cd <gn4124 core dir>/hdl/spec/syn/
$ hdlmake -f
$ hdlmake --ise-proj
$ hdlmake --make-ise
$ make

Memory map:

0x00000 : GN4124 DMA configuration registers
          -> See GN4124 doc for register mapping.
0x40000 : Status registers
      0 : 0xDEADBABE
      4 : 0xBEEFFACE
      8 : 0x12345678
      C : Bit 0 = P2L PLL lock status (1=pll locked)
0x80000 : Control regiters
      0 : Not connected internally, can be used to perform r/w
      4 : Not connected internally, can be used to perform r/w
      8 : Not connected internally, can be used to perform r/w
      C : Bits 0 and 1 connected to SPEC front-panel LEDs (1=LED ON)
